# To Do List React Example

## Why?

A small To-Do list project to learn React.

This small example will likely only support a single JS file to hold all components.

## How?

All functional code is stored in `src/app.js` so changes should be made here.

To build the `app.js` file that is used on `index.html`, run `npm run build` in the terminal to build the file.
